# Testing Complete Integration

Below is a simple HTML test page to verify the frontend-backend connection.

Navigate to this file and open it in the browser to test:

## Test Steps:
1. Open DevTools Console (F12)
2. Check if you see:
   - "API Service Initializing..."
   - "Backend URL: http://localhost:5000"
   - "Fetching from backend: /api/tmdb/trending/all/week"
   - Movie data logged to console

If you see these logs, the connection is working!
